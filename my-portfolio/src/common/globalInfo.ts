export const ProfessionalSummary: string =
  "As a software engineer and consultant, I have worked with various clients to deliver high-quality web applications using Angular, JavaScript, .NET, C#, and SQL. I collaborate with other developers, designers, and stakeholders to ensure the projects meet the requirements and expectations of the clients.";

export const AboutMeInfo: string[] = [
  "I began my coding journey in 2018 as a hobby by taking a local 'Intro to Code' class and I immediately became interested in building software. I decided to make a pivot from a career in wealth management and enrolled in Fullstack Academy of Code, and have been working professionally as a software engineer since 2019.",
  "For the past two and a half years I have had the opportunity to work as a software consultant. I enjoy growing my technical skills while working directly with stakeholders, including product owners, project managers, UX designers, etc. I've worked as a lead with team members abroad and a solo engineer on a production app with 10,000 users and everything in between. I find I enjoy working in a collaborative environment the most.",
  "Outside of work I spend my time camping across California and I'm always interested in hearing about new campgrounds. I'm also a tech enthusiast and love building PCs and tinkering on my homelab server. And of course, Sundays in the fall are often dedicated to NFL football. Go Packers!"
